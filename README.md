## Eric's Conway's Game of Life

This is a JavaScript/canvas emulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, with one addition: 2x2 cluters of cells are counted as "eggs" and have the potential to "hatch" into lines of cells if they survive for longer than 40 seconds. Cells that have died are marked with a "ghost" color for 3 generations after dying.
